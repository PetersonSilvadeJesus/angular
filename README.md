# App Angular

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.3.

### Requirements
1. **Node.js**: Angular requires a current, active LTS, or maintenance LTS version of Node.js.
2. **npm package manager**: Angular, the Angular CLI, and Angular applications depend on npm packages for many features and functions.

### Installation

` npm install -g @angular/cli `

#### Create a workspace and initial application

` ng new my-app `

> The Angular CLI includes a server, so that you can build and serve your app locally.

Navigate to the workspace folder, such as my-app. Run the following command:

` cd my-app`
` ng serve --open `

> The ng serve command launches the server, watches your files, and rebuilds the app as you make changes to those files.
The --open (or just -o) option automatically opens your browser to http://localhost:4200/.

If your installation and setup was successful, you should see a page similar to the following.
